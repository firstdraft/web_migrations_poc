# Web Migrations POC

Students spend a disproportionate amount of of their mental energy trying to understand what migrations are. I'd like to abstract this away for the time being by creating a GUI for managing their database structure.

This is a proof of concept for what will eventually become a Rails engine for doing so. Start the server and navigate to `/dev/tables`
